# Pokemon_TypeR

Ongoing side project to develop an R package and/or Shiny app to give Pokemon type predictions that are good against your opponent's Pokemon.

Part 1, the data exploration in Python, is complete. The Jupyter Notebook is saved in this repository. The data is from Kaggle's Pokemon dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/pokemon

Parts 2 and 3, the package and app, are now in progress.
