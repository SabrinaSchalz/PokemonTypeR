Description: This package has two functions to help you select Pokemon that either have a strong attack
		or strong defence against your opponent. This can be based on the types of Pokemon your opponent
		uses (type function), or the name of the Pokemon your opponent uses (name function).
		The package also has a function to show you the share of Pokemon that have a given type (share function),
		as well as a function that gives you three random example Pokemons that have a certain type (example function),
		both of which are meant to help you narrow down the type selection. The dataset was built from the raw data
		"The Complete "Pokemon Dataset" published by ROUNAK BANIK under a CC0 1.0 Universal licence
